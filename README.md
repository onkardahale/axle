# Axle

Axle is a command-line tool that helps you write better commit messages using AI. It analyzes your code changes and suggests a commit message in a structured format.

## Features

- 🤖 AI-powered commit message generation using the Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct model
- 🔄 Interactive regeneration of commit messages (in-development)
- 💾 Automatic model caching for faster subsequent runs
- 🛠️ Configurable generation parameters
- 📚 Support for conventional commit types and scopes

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/onkardahale/axle.git
```

## Usage

1. Stage your changes:
```bash
git add .
```

2. Generate a commit message:
```bash
axle 
```

3. The tool will:
   - Analyze your staged changes
   - Generate a commit message
   - Open your default editor for review
   - Create the commit if you save and close the editor

## Project History

This project was developed using Axle itself! 
Here are some of the commit messages that were generated by Axle during development:

```
ca0e81ef60ca52f40fa6345bcdf74deefc6020e7
feat(tests): Add new test files for AI utils
```


``` 
2535d745da45049509b4690217fd494a0c2da32d
feat(axle): Add initial implementation of axle CLI tool
```

```
0618e91c437c540b64dea6394a79151d9faa2e4b
feat(src/axle): Add AI-based commit message generation functionality
```

Each commit message was automatically generated by Axle based on the actual changes made to the codebase.

## Configuration

The tool uses a configuration file at `~/.cache/axle/model_config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
    "model_name": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_new_tokens": 200,
    "top_p": 0.95,
    "top_k": 50
}
```

You can modify these parameters to adjust the generation behavior.

## Commit Message Format

Commit messages are generated in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
    "type": "feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore",
    "scope": "optional-scope",
    "description": "concise description of changes"
}
```
