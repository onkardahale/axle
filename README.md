# Axle

Axle is a command-line tool that helps you write better commit messages using AI. It analyzes your code changes and suggests a commit message in a structured format.

## Features

- 🤖 AI-powered commit message generation using the Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct model
- 📚 Local knowledge base for improved context-aware commit messages
- 🔄 Interactive regeneration of commit messages with user context
- 🔗 Issue linking and breaking change declarations
- 💾 Automatic model caching for faster subsequent runs
- 🛠️ Configurable generation parameters
- 📚 Support for conventional commit types and scopes
- 🌳 Tree-sitter based code parsing for better context understanding
- 🌐 Extensible language support through tree-sitter grammars

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/onkardahale/axle.git
```

## Usage

1. Initialize the knowledge base (recommended for better commit messages):
```bash
axle init
```

2. Stage your changes:
```bash
git add .
```

3. Generate a commit message:
```bash
axle commit
```

4. The tool will:
   - Analyze your staged changes
   - Use the knowledge base for context (if available)
   - Generate a commit message
   - Open your default editor for review
   - Prompt for issue linking and breaking changes
   - Create the commit if you save and close the editor

## Knowledge Base

The `axle init` command creates a local knowledge base in the `.axle` directory of your project. This knowledge base:

- Analyzes your codebase using tree-sitter for accurate parsing
- Extracts structural information, docstrings, and imports
- Categorizes files based on their purpose
- Provides rich context for commit message generation
- Supports multiple programming languages through tree-sitter grammars

The knowledge base is automatically used when generating commit messages, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant messages.

### Language Support

While Axle currently focuses on Python codebases, it's designed to be language-agnostic through its use of tree-sitter. The project uses `tree-sitter-language-pack` which provides built-in support for multiple languages. This architecture allows for easy expansion to support languages like:
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Java
- Go
- Rust
- C/C++
- And many more

To add support for a new language, you can:
1. Ensure the language is included in `tree-sitter-language-pack`
2. Add language-specific parsing rules to the Axle project
3. Configure the language parser in the knowledge base

## Interactive Features

After generating a commit message, you can:

1. **Commit**: Save and commit the message
2. **Edit**: Modify the message in your editor
3. **Regenerate**: Generate a new message with additional context
4. **Abort**: Cancel the commit

You'll also be prompted to:
- Link related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Declare breaking changes with descriptions

## Project History

This project was developed using Axle itself! 
Here are some of the commit messages that were generated by Axle during development:

```
ca0e81ef60ca52f40fa6345bcdf74deefc6020e7
feat(tests): Add new test files for AI utils
```

``` 
2535d745da45049509b4690217fd494a0c2da32d
feat(axle): Add initial implementation of axle CLI tool
```

```
0618e91c437c540b64dea6394a79151d9faa2e4b
feat(src/axle): Add AI-based commit message generation functionality
```

Each commit message was automatically generated by Axle based on the actual changes made to the codebase.

## Configuration

The tool uses a configuration file at `~/.cache/axle/model_config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
    "model_name": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct",
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_new_tokens": 200,
    "top_p": 0.95,
    "top_k": 50
}
```

You can modify these parameters to adjust the generation behavior.

## Commit Message Format

Commit messages are generated in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
    "type": "feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore",
    "scope": "optional-scope",
    "description": "concise description of changes"
}
```

The final commit message will include:
- Type and scope (if any)
- Description
- Issue references (if provided)
- Breaking change description (if declared)

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Git
- A text editor (vim, nano, etc.)

## Dependencies

- click
- transformers
- torch
- accelerate
- tree-sitter (>=0.20.3,<0.23.0)
- tree-sitter-language-pack
- pydantic (>=2.0.0)
