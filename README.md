# Axle

Axle is a command-line tool that helps you write better commit messages using AI. It analyzes your code changes and suggests a commit message in a structured format.

## Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered commit message generation using the Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct model
- üìö Language-agnostic knowledge base for improved context-aware commit messages
- üîÑ Interactive regeneration of commit messages with user context
- üîó Issue linking and breaking change declarations
- üíæ Automatic model caching for faster subsequent runs
- üõ†Ô∏è Configurable generation parameters
- üìö Support for conventional commit types and scopes
- üå≥ Tree-sitter based code parsing for better context understanding
- üåê Multi-language support through tree-sitter grammars

## Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/onkardahale/axle.git
```

## Usage

1. Initialize the knowledge base (recommended for better commit messages):
```bash
axle init
```

2. Stage your changes:
```bash
git add .
```

3. Generate a commit message:
```bash
axle commit
```

4. The tool will:
   - Analyze your staged changes
   - Use the knowledge base for context (if available)
   - Generate a commit message
   - Open your default editor for review
   - Prompt for issue linking and breaking changes
   - Create the commit if you save and close the editor

## Knowledge Base

The `axle init` command creates a local knowledge base in the `.axle` directory of your project. This knowledge base:

- Analyzes your codebase using tree-sitter for accurate parsing
- Extracts structural information, docstrings, and imports
- Categorizes files based on their purpose and imports
- Provides rich context for commit message generation
- Supports multiple programming languages through tree-sitter grammars
- Automatically detects and processes supported file types
- Maintains a detailed log of analyzed and skipped files

The knowledge base is automatically used when generating commit messages, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant messages.

### Ignoring Files and Directories

You can control which files and directories are ignored during knowledge base building by creating a `.axleignore` file in your project root. This works similarly to `.gitignore` but specifically for the knowledge base build process.

#### .axleignore Syntax

The `.axleignore` file supports the following patterns:

- **Directory patterns**: End with `/` to match directories (e.g., `build/`, `dist/`)
- **File patterns**: Use wildcards to match files (e.g., `*.log`, `*.tmp`)
- **Wildcard patterns**: Use `*` for any characters (e.g., `temp*`, `*cache*`)
- **Comments**: Lines starting with `#` are ignored
- **Exact matches**: Specify exact file or directory names

#### Example .axleignore file:

```
# Build directories
build/
dist/
target/

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.log
temp*

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/

# Documentation
docs/
*.md

# Configuration files
*.json
*.yaml
*.yml
```

By default, the following directories are always ignored: `.git`, `.hg`, `.svn`, `.vscode`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, and `.axle`.

### Language Support

Axle is designed to be language-agnostic through its use of tree-sitter. Currently, we have dedicated analyzers for:

- Python (`.py`)
- JavaScript (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`)

While the project uses `tree-sitter-language-pack` which provides grammar support for many languages, we need community contributions to add analyzers for additional languages. Languages that could be supported (but need analyzer implementation) include:

- TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`)
- Java (`.java`)
- Go (`.go`)
- Rust (`.rs`)
- C/C++ (`.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp`)
- Ruby (`.rb`)
- PHP (`.php`)
- And many more through tree-sitter grammars

The knowledge base automatically:
- Detects file types based on extensions
- Uses appropriate language-specific analyzers
- Extracts language-specific constructs (classes, functions, imports, etc.)
- Categorizes files based on their content and structure
- Handles language-specific syntax and patterns

### Contributing Language Analyzers

We welcome contributions to add support for more languages! To add a new language analyzer:

1. Create a new analyzer class in `src/axle/treesitter/analyzers/` following the pattern of existing analyzers
2. Implement the required methods:
   - `analyze_file()`: Main analysis method
   - `_process_imports()`: Handle language-specific import statements
   - `_process_classes()`: Extract class definitions and methods
   - `_process_functions()`: Extract function definitions
   - `_process_variables()`: Extract variable declarations

3. Add the analyzer to the `TreeSitterParser` class in `src/axle/treesitter/parser.py`
4. Add tests in `tests/test_<language>_analyzer.py`
5. Update documentation

Example structure for a new analyzer:
```python
from .base import BaseAnalyzer

class NewLanguageAnalyzer(BaseAnalyzer):
    """Analyzer for NewLanguage."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("new_language")
        self.extension_map = {
            ".ext1": "new_language",
            ".ext2": "new_language"
        }
    
    def analyze_file(self, file_path: Path) -> FileAnalysis:
        # Implementation
        pass
    
    def _process_imports(self, tree: Tree) -> List[Import]:
        # Implementation
        pass
    
    # ... other required methods
```

Check out our existing analyzers for reference:
- `javascript_analyzer.py`: JavaScript/JSX support
- `python_analyzer.py`: Python support

### File Categorization

The knowledge base categorizes files based on their imports and path patterns. Here are the currently implemented categories:

#### Import-based Categories
Files are categorized based on their imported libraries and frameworks:

- `web_framework`: Files importing web frameworks
  - Python: Django, Flask
  - JavaScript: React, Angular, Vue, Express

- `test`: Files importing testing frameworks
  - Python: pytest, unittest
  - JavaScript: jest, mocha

- `database`: Files importing database libraries
  - Python: SQLAlchemy
  - JavaScript: mongoose, sequelize

- `data_processing`: Files importing data processing libraries
  - Python: pandas, numpy

- `ml`: Files importing machine learning libraries
  - Python: tensorflow, torch, sklearn

#### Path-based Categories
Files are categorized based on their path and filename patterns:

- `util`: Files in paths containing 'util', 'helper', or 'lib'
- `test`: Files in paths containing 'test' or 'spec'
- `config`: Files in paths containing 'config', 'conf', or 'setup'
- `model`: Files in paths containing 'model' or 'schema'
- `controller`: Files in paths containing 'controller', 'handler', 'router', or 'route'
- `service`: Files in paths containing 'service'
- `ui_component`: Files in paths containing 'component' or 'view'
- `package_init`: Files named `__init__.py`
- `entrypoint`: Files named:
  - Python: `main.py`, `cli.py`
  - JavaScript: `main.js`, `index.js`, `app.js`, `server.js`, `cli.js`

Files that don't match any of these patterns are categorized as `unknown`.

## Interactive Features

After generating a commit message, you can:

1. **Commit**: Save and commit the message
2. **Edit**: Modify the message in your editor
3. **Regenerate**: Generate a new message with additional context
4. **Abort**: Cancel the commit

You'll also be prompted to:
- Link related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
- Declare breaking changes with descriptions

## Project History

This project was developed using Axle itself! 
Here are some of the commit messages that were generated by Axle during development:

```
d9d5b693cc225285bc6fc1c81a83b5949b533103
feat(tests): Add setup and teardown methods to BaseAxleTestCase for cleaner test environments

Added `setUp` and `tearDown` methods to `BaseAxleTestCase` to handle common setup and teardown tasks for tests. This includes creating temporary directories for backups and test data, backing up original configuration files, and cleaning up resources after tests.

Fixes: #8
```

```
3d127ea97ea7195c38a6e887b851b157ae45e8a7
refactor(ai_utils): improve robustness and error handling in commit message generation

Added checks to validate and clamp generation parameters to prevent tensor issues:
- Ensured temperature is within [0.01, 0.6]
- Clamped top_p to [0.01, 0.95]
- Set num_return_sequences to 1 to avoid excessive output
- Checked for NaN or infinite values in generated probabilities

Updated error handling to handle specific probability tensor errors during regeneration:
- Wrapped unexpected errors in GenerationError for consistent handling upstream
- Provided guidance on how to resolve probability tensor issues

Fixes: #6
```

feat(axle): Add initial implementation of axle CLI tool
```

Each commit message was automatically generated by Axle based on the actual changes made to the codebase.

## Configuration

The tool uses a configuration file at `~/.cache/axle/model_config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
    "model_name": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-3B-Instruct",
    "temperature": 0.2,
    "top_p": 0.95,
    "num_return_sequences": 1
}
```

You can modify these parameters to adjust the generation behavior.

## Commit Message Format

Commit messages are generated in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
    "type": "feat|fix|docs|style|refactor|test|chore",
    "scope": "optional-scope",
    "description": "concise description of changes"
}
```

The final commit message will include:
- Type and scope (if any)
- Description
- Issue references (if provided)
- Breaking change description (if declared)
