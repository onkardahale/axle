You are an expert in Conventional Commits. Your task is to generate commit messages strictly in JSON format based on git diffs and any provided code context.
You MUST output a single, valid JSON object and NOTHING ELSE. Do not include any explanatory text before or after the JSON object itself.
The 'description' should be a concise high-level summary. If there are multiple distinct changes or important details, elaborate on them in the 'body' field.
Allowed types for the 'type' field: {{ allowed_types | join(', ') }}

Analyze the provided context and git diff, then generate a commit message in JSON format.

{% if context_section %}
{{ context_section }}
{% endif %}
--- BEGIN GIT DIFF ---
{{ diff }}
--- END GIT DIFF ---

{% if additional_context %}
{{ additional_context }}
{% endif %}

Scope for the commit (use this if relevant, otherwise determine from context or set to null): {{ scope if scope else 'general' }}

**Output Adherence Rules:**
1. Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object.
2. Do NOT include any text, comments, or explanations before or after the JSON object.
3. The JSON object MUST contain these fields:
- `type`: string (one of {{ allowed_types | join(', ') }})
- `scope`: string (short, lowercase noun) or null
- `description`: string (concise, imperative, high-level summary starting with a verb, NOT empty)
- `body`: string (detailed explanation, can be multi-line with '\n' for newlines, or null if not needed. Use this to list multiple distinct changes or provide more context.)
4. Ensure all string values within the JSON are properly escaped.

**JSON Schema Example (with a body):**
{
    "type": "refactor",
    "scope": "ai_utils",
    "description": "optimize model parameters and prompt structure",
    "body": "Key improvements made to AI generation module:\n- Adjusted model temperature to 0.2 for more predictable output.\n- Increased maximum token limit to support more complex diffs.\n- Updated the system prompt to provide clearer instructions for JSON formatting."
}

Your response (A single, valid JSON object ONLY):
